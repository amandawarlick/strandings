It was a large porpoise slightly scavenged. On May 11, 2014, Mary Jo Adams investigated the carcass, but it required a tram to remove it from the beach. A team was mustered at 5pm and the carcass was carried by soft-stretcher off the beach with the assistance of RP Cooper. He had obtained easy access to the truck through private property (Surfcrest is a gated private community)to shorten the transport distance. The carcass was frozen for necropsy. Necropsy examination 6/21/14, by Dr, Stephanie Norman et al. Teeth were taken for the aging study, Morphometrics were recorded. No actual necropsy was performed due to the advanced stage of s decomposition and extensive scavenging of the carcass. (More scavenging by eagles occurred between sighting on May 10 and pickup on May 11.) Blubber samples were frozen in foil for toxins study. The skull was removed and will be sent to Baylor University for an ear plug study, after which the skull will be returned. The rest of the skeleton was flensed and frozen for educational purposes. The female was pregnant. A 67 cm long fetus was in the left horn. Male. Estimated at 4.8 kg. Estimated at being 3-4 weeks before birth. Amniotic fluid was collected. Fetus decomposing.

Scratched along skin near head and left side body, some rake marks and scars present, froth coming from blowhole. Feces coming from rectum. Dark circular ""bruises"" on left and right flanks. Returned morning of 18-Mar for necropsy. External Comments: Scratches/rake marks particularly around left body, pec fin, and head, minimal scaring right side body. At response, scavenging left fluke, scavenging (moderate) left side head, left eye scavenged, left pec fin scavenged, dorsal fin tip scavenged. Think scratches on body mostly post-mortem (no hemorrhage underneath). Case Summary Necropsy: OPEN: Kidney extensive emphysema/crepitus around; 100 mL fluid in thoracic cavity; lungs aerated/spongy and right lung congested; based on other strandings of striped dolphin in Oregon and possibility of live stranding/drowning suspect possible Brucella or other infectious agent. Lab Results MICROSCOPIC: Central nervous system: Moderate to marked, lymphocytic inflammation is present primarily around blood vessels throughout the meninges of the spinal cord and brain and around blood vessels and Virchow-Robins spaces of the brain at all levels and in the white matter and gray matter tracts of the spinal cord. Inflammation also extends into and along the root ganglia. Some mild myelinic edema is noted in the white matter tracts primarily in the ventrolateral region of the spinal cord and in some of the root ganglia. Lymph node: Mild eosinophilic inflammation is in the medullary sinuses. Lung: The parenchyma is congested and edematous, and a single small focus of lymphohistiocytic/eosinophilic inflammation surrounds a bronchiole. Liver: Mild portal infiltrates of lymphocytes and eosinophils are noted. The following tissues are histologically within normal limits: kidney. HISTOPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: 1. Marked nonsuppurative meningoencephalomyelitis and root ganglioneuritis. 2. Acute pulmonary congestion and edema. 3. Mild eosinophilic inflammation, liver, lymph node, and lung. COMMENT: Histologic findings are consistent with an infectious disease process that has a tropism for the central nervous system. The morphologic features and distribution of the lesion are most suggestive of viral infection. The lesion lacks the microglial nodule formation typically associated with protozoan infection and the suppurative components typically associated with most bacterial infections. No viral inclusions are seen in any of the sections. This is a case in which immunohistochemistry and PCR are indicated to screen for some of the important viral infections and protozoan infections that occur in cetaceans. Please notify the laboratory if you would like ancillary procedures performed. This animal has acute features in the lung that are consistent with drowning. It has some mild eosinophilic inflammation in various tissues typical of the parasitism that is commonly encountered in while cetaceans and pinnipeds. No parasites are seen in the sections. Addendum, 3/31/14: Following email discourse with multiple participants, it is understood that the morbillivirus PCR and viral culture procedures are pending at U.C. Davis, and that pending these results, PCR and IHC from paraffin block for pathogens may be indicated. I have reviewed pathology reports (but not slides) for similar striped dolphin submissions to other institutions and suggest that these cases may represent the same disease process. UC Davis Results 4/14/2014: Negative for Morbillivirus testing. NVSL Brucella culture 4/28/2014: Culture positive in brain tissue but not lung. Addendum, 5/21/14: As per your request, block 2 has been forwarded for Brucella PCR (USDA). An addendum will follow. IHC results via NW Zoopath 8/12/2014: Negative for Brucella.",

The specimen measured 86 cm at its longest dimension by 60 cm at the widest part. Thickness ranged from 1cm to 3 cm approximately. The top surface had a white patch surrounded on two sides by a shiny black border ranging from 5 to 8"" wide approx. The underside showed some muscle tissue. The blubber layer, at its thickest part measured 2.5 cm. There were 3 small bones stuck to the underside. One was pulled out an measured approx. 6"" in length. On one side of the specimen there were 4 semi-circular notches or bites and in one corner there was a short, clean, knife-like cut. The specimen was collected, bagged with ice and delivered to Brad Hanson for identification. Upon initial visual exam Brad Hanson determined the specimen to be a portion of the underside of a Dall's porpoise.","Susan Berta, CPSMMSN"

She first reported it as an orca calf but from her description on the phone (3.5 -4 feet long, black and white) we thought it was more likely a Dall's porpoise calf. They discovered it 100 feet from the stairs to the beach at Double Bluff Park,Freeland wrapped in seaweed. They had plastic trash bags with them so packed it in the bags and left it near the steps while responders headed down to collect it. Upon examination,responders found a harbor porpoise calf in good condition. A few small scrapes and one cut, or possible scavenger peck on the left jaw and some skin beginning to peel.There was a foamy discharge coming from the blowhole. A small sample of that was collected in a syringe. The porpoise was put on ice in a large cooler awaiting necropsy scheduled for July 10. Necropsy July 10, 2009. Age neonate. 87 cm from tip of snout to fluke notch. Girth at front of dorsal fin: 46.9 cm. Blubber: dorsal 1 cm, lateral 1.3 cm, ventral 1.4 cm. Blubber samples frozen for Brad Hanson , MML, and Pace Labs for dioxin testing. Good post mortem condition. Scavenging on neck and left eye. Poor nutritional condition. Flukes and dorsal fin still folded. No parasites noted. Teeth not yet erupted. Pink tinged foam coming from blowhole.o Primary incision: thorax contained red-tinged clearish fluid, apprx 5 ml. Blubber yellow, icteric. Foam in airways. Trachea contained small amount yellow tinged foam. Lungs floated. Stomach contents: meconium. Collected and frozen. Bladder empty. Comments: caldftook breaths. Umbilical stump still attached. No evidence of nursing. Calf approx 1-2 days old. No gross visible signs of trauma, infection or other physical abnormalities. Cause of dearth:unknown. Complete sets of tissues collected frozen and formalin for analysis. Necropsy results from Dr. Norman: poor nutritional condition. Neonate had taken breath before expiring. Necropsy results from Dr. Raverty: the aspirated squames and meconiom are suggestive of fetal distress type syndrome and in conjunction with the lack of ingesta in the gastrointestinal tract, would have been sufficiently severe to account for the lack of this neonate.

I am one of the surveillance officers here at the Canadian Forces MARPAC HQ. I am emailing you in regards to the dead whale that you were inquiring about earlier this morning to the Op Centre Watch Floor. The flight crew that spotted the carcass surmised that it was a fin whale carcass, and it was spotted approx. 100 nm West of the mouth of Juan De Fuca Strait (Cape Flattery). It's location was 47 35 N 127 30W at about 10:00 AM on 31 May. Doing some regressive drift modelling going back 3 weeks, we determined that it had made it's way southbound before it was sighted, with the probability that it would continue on its southerly drift pattern. Drift modelling showed that it did not move very far south to the point where it was sighted given no windage effects. As for current position, we have not been able to ascertain its location since first and last sighting on 31 May. Please feel free to ask any questions if you have.

Complete set of tissues taken for further analysis. Blubber samples frozen in foil for possible test for dioxins/furans. Photos of necropsy at CPSMMSN archives No significant findings COD: unknown at this time. Necropsy findings: Based on the apparent age of this animal (neonate)), the accumulation of aspirated squames and meconium throughout the lungs is suggestive of a fetal distress type syndrome, possibly related to dystochia, premature placental detachment or some other process. Failure to suckle may be related to a nonviable neonate, maternal neglect or loss.

The description sounded similar to the first porpoise with a lot of scavenging - but the location of the carcass caused us to believe this was a second animal. The message was received at about 8:30 pm. Howard Garrett and Susan Berta returned to Fort Casey, arriving about 9pm. With fading light and rising tide, we made it to the porpoise site just before dark. We were able to determine that this was a second porpoise, though in similar condition to the first - highly scavenged and too decomposed to collect tissue samples. since we had to walk back in darkness and with a rising tide, we were able to only take a quick measurement and some photos, then tied the carcass to driftlogs. We returned the next afternoon, May 12, to further examine the carcass and take a blubber sample. KOMO 4 News came and covered the story. This was a larger porpoise, female, 58.5"", but too scavenged and decomposed to determine cause of death. The carcass was marked with a green grease pen ""X"" and left at the site (near the driftwood at high tide line )- the park was busy and most people were down at the waterline, so we left it where people would have less interaction with it, hoping the next tide would take it out. During a COASST walk on May 16, Jill Hein, Sandy Dubpernell, Kelly Zupich and Gary Donovan, Stranding Network responders, came upon the porpoise carcass left by Susan and Howard.

The report was of a large gray whale floating just offshore approximately 1 mile south of the South Whidbey State Park beach access. Matt Klope and Howard Garrett of the Stranding Network investigated the carcass on Sunday, April 10. The carcass of the adult female was emaciated. No major injuries were noted. The whale was not one of the 10-12 grays that come into our waters to feed for several months each spring. Matt removed some whiskers for possible analysis as well as part of the ""chin"" on the mandible for researchers to check for a possible ""sensory organ"" suspected to be located in that region. A necropsy was performed on April 12 by Cascadia Research Collective and the CPSMMSN. Several scars on the ovary may mean that the female had had several calves. The stomach was empty except for some organic material and small rocks. The intestines were completely empty. There were lots of small nodules throughout the intestine. Samples were taken for analysis. The CPSMMSN collected several blubber samples for testing for levels of dioxins and furans. The strip of baleen from the left side of the jaw was collected. Cascadia Research Collective will prepare the necropsy report. The carcass was left at site at this fairly remote area of beach in an attempt to collect the second strip of baleen at some future date.","Matt Klope, Howard Garrett"

As the responders prepared to investigate, Ken called back at 11:36 after talking with the neighbors - they reported it had been swimming circles a short time before and Ken was unsure if the porpoise was still alive, or had died. Responders arrived on the scene at approx 11;45 and the porpoise was about 5' from the water's edge, floating upright, but no longer moving. The mouth was slightly ajar. They brought it to the beach and confirmed that it had died. The neighbors who had seen it earlier that morning reported it as alive and swimming in circles near the beach at 10:54 AM. They took photos at that time which they will send to CPSMMSN. A neighbor said he had seen it yesterday swimming around in the same area. The carcass was collected and transported to the SN necropsy facility where it was necropsied later that afternoon 1/1/11. Necropsy performed on still warm fresh carcass on 1/1/11 by Dr. S.Norman et al. Some ulcerated lesions were seen externally around the mouth and ovoid shaped whitish gray marks on lateral surface. Tubercles were seen on upper edge of dorsal fin. Rake marks on base of peduncle. Multiple (>100) disseminated, 2-3 mm bright yellow, calcified nodules in fascia beneath blubber layer along dorsum and lateral sides of thorax and abdomen -possible parasitic cysts. Firm 3mm diameter lesions in bronchi and bronchiolar spaces, tannish in color. Substantial foam noted in bronchi and trachea. 12-14 cm fish located in esophagus proximal to gastroesophageal sphincter. Stomach empty except for gastric fluids. Many liver flukes, ducts filled with nematodes. Filamentous objects seen in left side of cerebrum (nerve fibers?) There were no obvious lesions that could point to a specific COD. Hepatic and pulmonary parasitism did not appear to be greater than normally noted in free-ranging harbor porpoises. COD: could not be determined at this time","Susan Berta, Howard Garrett"

The line used was small-gauge nylon, and secured the right flipper to a large cleat on the dock. In addition, ca 55' of 3/8"" rope was found tied to the caudal peduncle. It appears likely that the animal was found floating dead in or near Bellingham Bay and was towed to Squalicum Harbor before being secured to the dock. It is unclear how long the animal had been secured to the dock, but the body cavity had been fully exposed by the action of scavengers (see photos, attached file). In addition, the body cavity, internal organs, and flesh around the thoracic cavity were very gas-filled and bloated. Finally, the line found tied to the caudal peduncle has considerable growth of macroalgae and encrusting invertebrates (Though this may have accumulated prior to the animal being secured to the dock). Attempts were made to dis-articulate the carcass and release the accumulated gasses. Once this was accomplished the carcass was sunk on-site below the unused dock (Which is inaccessible to the general public due to closure for long term construction project).",

An attempt was made to tow the carcass to the sea plane base.It failed. A blubber sample was obtained. A larger boat managed to tow the carcass to Polnell Point, NASWI, sea plane base. Necropsy: performed by the additional identifiers above on April 29, 2009. Blubber: dorsal 9.3 cm, lateral 9.1 cm, ventral 9.0 cm. Fluke width 319 cm. Whale measured 41 feet in length. Fair body condition. Moderate decomp. Large amount of blood in body cavity, bruising in some areas of the blubber layer and in some internal organs.Stomach full of recently ingested prey (ghost shrimp). Findings suggestive of blunt force trauma, likely caused by collision with a large ship. Histological testing: Dr. Stephen Raverty. Post mortem decomp and artifactual sloughing of the mucosa from multiple viscera hindered microscopic assessment of the tissues and precluded precise determination of possible antemortem trauma or post mortem putrifaction. In gray whales it is not unusual to observe large quantities of serosanguinous acsites, however, without the presence of blood clots or fibrin deposition along serosal surfaces it is difficult to differentiate frank hemorrhage vs post mortem pooling of fluid within the abdomen. There were no significant lesions within the tissues.The levels of BUN, calcium and phosphorus appear within acceptable limits for a stranded cetacean. PCR of pooled tissues was negative for morbillivirus. No bacteria isolated. The carcass was left at site for cleaning by scavengers. Several weeks later the CPSMMSN collected as many bones as could be found, including the entire skull, mandible and baleen, vertebrae, ribs, scapulae for educational/scientific purposes. Bones collected for educational/scientific use: skull left and right mandibles scapulae 13 ribs right side 12 ribs left side sternum atlas axis 7 cervical vertebrae 27 other vertebrae hyoid arch (3 bones) hip bones (2)","Matt Klope, Cascadia Research Collective, CPSMMSN volunteers"

It was only observed for one surfacing from the air, never observable by boat, it was not visible during the next surfacing after a long dive. The fetus was very recently aborted and traces of the umbilicus were still visible. John believes they witnessed the first of surfacing of the mother after abortion. The presumed mother, K27, surfaced after a long dive seen pushing the fetus for a single surfacing run, and then the fetus was not visable. Email correspondence about the observed event is attached to the hard copy Level A.

Norman,"Carcass located on Sep 21, 2014 around 11am about 1.2 miles north of Ebey's Landing beach parking lot. Found in mid-tidal area of beach and moved to high tide zone until pickup. Body showed scavenging holes around left eye and eye area. Lots of scrape marks all over body from rolling on pebbles and in the sand and possible claw or peck marks from scavenging birds. Otherwise the body was intact. The skin was scraped off a large area of the center left side. The carcass was carried off trhe beach around noon and placed into the cooler with ice around 1:30 pm. Delivered to SN headquarters in Freeland where it was kept on ice until necroposy on Sept. 23. There were NSF of the internal organs. Upon opening the skull for examination of the brain, the ventral brain stem was surrounded by hemorrhage extending to the ventral base of the skull and surrounding the entire caudal part of the cerebellum. Hemorrhage was also found deep into the atlas/axis area. Hemorrhage is on the right side of deep connective tissue beneath the blubber by C1 and C2 and surrounding the spinal cord. Update from J. Higgins: I received photos from Susan from the day that they got the stranding report, they collected and examined at least one day later. In the original photos you can clearly see monofilament impressions around the head and rostrum, but by the time they examined the animal themselves they could not see them anymore due to skin cracking and sloughing. I reviewed the photos with Stephanie Norman later (she had done the necropsy) and she agreed that it was an entanglement case based on the impressions in the photos, even though they did not see them at the necropsy.",Brenda Dewey

On the 29th Makah Fisheries, with help from Dan Greene, towed the whale to Neah Bay for further examination. On the 30th a necropsy was conducted. Based on the necropsy it is very likely that the whale died due to a shipstrike although not quickly. The flesh around injured area from ship strike was necrotic rather than bruised. This may have been because the whale lived through the injury and succombed to secondary bacterial infections from the injury. Stomach was empty. Bones and baleen were collected by Makah tribal members for cultural purposes pursuant to Makah Fisheries Annual Regulation 2014-2. Internal observations were similar to external observation that a large injury occurred to the left side of the dorsal surface of the whale. Tissue around the injury was very necrotic and friable. The rib immediately under where the injury occurred was broken, the ribs adjacent to the broken rib appeared normal. Stomach was mostly empty suggesting that the whale had not recently eaten before it died. Most of the internal organs were too necrotic and decomposed to be of much use for evaluation or histology. The samples will be provided to ZooPath in the future.",

As it was dark, we asked the RP to secure the animal high up on the beach and responded the next morning. Susan and Marty responded in gale force winds and driving rain the morning of 11/21/06, found the porpoise and commandeered two young construcion workers to help haul it back to the car. Part of one side of the face has been scavenged, the body is intact though a bit bloated. Due to extreme weather conditions, two quick photos and GPS readings were taken on the beach, then we hauled it to the car. Susan later measured the porpoise, but could not access the porpoise in the back of the car well enough to determine gender or do a full examination. A necropsy is scheduled for Nov. 22 with Stephanie Norman and CPSMMSN team.",

Adult female estimated in the water to be 35' long. Right pectoral fin measured 8'long by 2' 8"" wide. From tip of rostrom to corner of mouth measured at 7'6"". Fluke width tip to tip was 9'6"". The skin was sunburned and sloughing off in sheets. There were several barnacles along the dorsal surface, on and under pec fins and on rostrom. Estimated 10% coverage. There was bleeding noted from barnacle wounds under the right pec fin. Several bird pecks were noted. Responders reported possible vessel prop strike on dorsal surface from behind skull and continuing back for about 6'. Cuts 1/4"" to 1"" deep. Fresh scars. At necropsy these scars were considered to be superficial. Blood was oozing from the blowhole. The eye was starting to bubble from the sun. There was a slight odor, but no bloating noted yet. The animal appeared to be underweight. There were signs of human interaction-entanglement scars on tailstock indicating an old injury unrelated to the stranding. A full necropsy was performed on 4/13 by Cascadia Research Collective, Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network and Dr.Michael Etnier, UW.
