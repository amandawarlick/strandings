## Notes - general strandings

Frungillo 2014
- examining strandings to identify competition between species; grey seals increase, decreasing or stable in harbor seals - reflects local abundance
- hs peaked may through june, peak of HI as well, but number, not proportion
- gray seal HI peak in summer

Steiger 1989
- mortality of harbor seals at smith island

Osinga 2012
- netherlands 79-08
- peak in pupping season
- age classes, sex ratio by cause
- bycatch highest cause in sub adults and adults, highest in summer
- reflected population increase and seasonal/local distribution

Hart 2007
- bycatch highest in spring-summer

Harris and Gupta 2006
- GIS 96-02 gulf of maine
- created high "seal stranding density" areas
- spatial theories/discussion
- cite increase in strandings to: increase pop, fish stocks, environmental conditions, increasing effort
- chi sq for categorical, K-W for numerical
- seasonality of location
- strandings follow seasonal presence

Osinga 2011
- Strandings as evidence of shift in pupping season/date

Johnston 2015
- patterns likely due to abundance trends
- cite short/long-term environmental perterbations and variation in local abundance
- chow test in R for breakpoint analysis
- gray seal increase ~ 20% since 90s

Leeney 2008
- cetacean strandings over almost 100 years in cornwall
- frequency has increased, due to: effort, change in abundance, or climate-related range shifts
- can learn about bycatch from strandings (ref Rogan 01, Kemper 05, Kirk 97)
- factors influencing strandings (ref Hart 06, Brabyn and McClean 92)
- overall, found strong seasonal/decadal trends
- similar to Jepson 2005 (increasing effort and distrib/abundance)

Gulland and Hall 2007
- marmam health deteriorating?

Bishop
- 50 hs strandings in san juan county/year, 71% pups
- high prevalence of blunt trauma

Stroud and Roffe 1979
- causes: gunshot, blunt trauma, parasites, multiple species along oregon coast

Norman 2004
- PNW oceanography/drift details
- strandings sample effort
- unusual distribution of cetaceans during ENSO
- stranding hotspots: astoria, yachats, newport, neah, oly pen, san juans
- summer peak attrib to more people, seasonal presence, winds
- moving inshore for upwelling, majority stranded in WA
- Woodhouse 91 - reflect local abundance
- compare numbers to AK and CA
- strandings can supplement knowledge about species abundance
- HI can provide need to closer monitor certain areas, inform mitigation
- ID novel diseases, population movements

Maldini 2005
- examining strandings to measure abundance

###UNincorporated

McCullagh, M. J. (2006). 
- Detecting hotspots in time and space
- Importance of a "mixed spatial and temporal approach" so hotspot doesn't just find where something is highest, but also where something might be increasing or decreasing
- Good citations for recent mapping efforts (Ma 2006, Kulldorf 2001)
  *Ma J, Zeng D, and Chen H, 2006, Spatial-Temporal Cross-Correlation Analysis: A New Measure and a Case Study in Infectious Disease Informatics, In Proceedings of the Intelligence and Security Informatics: IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI 2006), San Diego, CA, USA, May 23-24, 2006.*
- "Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation"
- Chainey and Radcliffe (2005) for more detailed explanation of hotspot calculations
  (*Chainey S, & Ratcliffe J, 2005, GIS and Crime Mapping, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN: 0470860995, 442 p*)
- Bailey and Gatrell 1996 for (a) kernel density calculation
    *Gatrell AC, Bailey, TC, Diggle, P and Rowlingson, BS, 1996, Spatial Point Pattern Analysis and its Application in Geographical Epidemiology, Trans. Inst Br Geogr NS 2: 256- 274.*
- (b) SaTScan (Kulldorf 2001 2005)
- (c) risk adjusted support vector clustering (RSVC)

Pikesley 2011
- from Peltier 14 - "underutilized resource"

Norman 2011 (1 discuss)
- spatial clustering; harbor porpoise UME in pacific northwest 06-07
- stat scan 
- global (regional; Knox) versus local (county; saTScan) levels
- first use of Knox for marmam strandings
- Kreuder 03 for satscan in otters
- K-W for months but no stat dif
- didn't detect any local clusters! but did detect global. just looking at age classes? what about overall?
- grieg 2005 for CSL satscan
- spatiotemporal "advantages bc doesn't require controls or pop dist parameters"
- long discussion of advantages (elliptical for elongated coastlines) and disadvantages 

Pyenson 2010 
- same as Maldini?
- cetacean carcass/strandings in north pacific

Pikesley 2011
- "underutilized"

**Peltier 2014
- drift prediction model (MOTHY) for cetaceans in english channel
- strandings as population indicators, though caveats and shortcomings - patchy "opportunistic" effort
- looking at strandings as a function of (a) animal - individual's biology/mortality, abundance, (b) oceanography, and (c) "societal component" (effort) - should try and ascertain this function to derive "indicators" based on strandings to enable standardized comparisons (modeled/expected versus observed = anomaly)
- Peltier 2013 seems important
- develop stranding probabilities in time and space
- really cool: "Detec- ting changes in populations by using map-based indicators is fairly uncommon, especially since map-based datasets rarely deal with time series."

**Moustaka 2016
- theory of epidemiology - aspects of the "disease" agent and environment simultaneously vary across time and space, changing the probability or vulnerability of contracting, in my case, stranding (Ward and Carpenter 2000 and Knox and Bartlett 1964)
- rise of availability of spatio-temporal data (remote imagery, etc)
- pitfalls of big data and what you lose in automation

Paiu 2016
- Romanian coast cetacean stranding timeseries
- peak in spring/summer, with lots of interannual variation
- citations for using strands (cetaceans) for estimating at-sea mortality (Peltier 2013/2012, Pyenson 2011/2010, Williams 2011) ###this looks plagiarized right from Peltier!
- strandings = "underutilized resource" Pikesley 2011 - so much plagiarism from peltier

Zeileis - strucchange

#More ENSO-related

- overall, not a lot of mapping has been done

- Lack of/need for more Bayesian modeling (Fay and Punt 2006 for habitat/abundance Bayes?)

Soulen 2013*

- neonate strandigns corr to sea ice (Johnston 2012)

- males more than females, pattern that is exacerbated by low sea ice
- sea ice and stranding ANOMALIES
- regressions
- genetics (lower gen diversity in males that strand)
- climate adaptation
- "decoupling" of abundance and stranding trends - everything is complex and simultaneously changing

- good references for environmental changes and oscillations
- combing several environmental variables
- difference between seasonal migrants and residents
