##Methodological Questions

- What are the things I should be cognizant of that are particular to my data? 
- How to deal with colinearity of oceanographic conditions, and seasonality of all strandings?
- How will the models deal with certain oceanographic variables not being available for the whole time series?

##To Dos

- Y/N stranding network member rates
- read multivariate/backwards
- ENSO cat lag
- stats table update?
- explore satScan
- Spearman and Kendall rank test; Vuong test
- Maps: kernel density: overall vs. LN/EN; satscan: overall as background, LN/EN
- Get inland buoy data?
- Derive lags: 6, mixed, fixed
- Split 2004 break
- Menza et al 2016 for local harbor seal abundance?
